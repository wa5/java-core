All Java variables must be identified with unique names.

These unique names are called identifiers.

Identifiers can be short names (like x and y) or more descriptive names (age, sum, totalVolume).

Note: It is recommended to use descriptive names in order to create understandable and maintainable code:

Example
public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Good
    int minutesPerHour = 60;

    // OK, but not so easy to understand what m actually is
    int m = 60;
    
    System.out.println(minutesPerHour);
    System.out.println(m);
  }
}
