What is String in java
Generally, String is a sequence of characters. But in Java, string is an object that represents a sequence of characters. The java.lang.String class is used to create a string object.

How to create a string object?
There are two ways to create String object:

By string literal
By new keyword




1) String Literal
Java String literal is created by using double quotes. For Example:

String s="welcome";  
Each time you create a string literal, the JVM checks the "string constant pool" first. If the string already exists in the pool, a reference to the pooled instance is returned. If the string doesn't exist in the pool, a new string instance is created and placed in the pool. For example:

String s1="Welcome";  
String s2="Welcome";//It doesn't create a new instance



2) By new keyword
String s=new String("Welcome");//creates two objects and one reference variable  
In such case, JVM will create a new string object in normal (non-pool) heap memory, and the literal "Welcome" will be placed in the string constant pool. The variable s will refer to the object in a heap (non-pool).
public class StringExample{  
public static void main(String args[]){  
String s1="java";//creating string by java string literal  
char ch[]={'s','t','r','i','n','g','s'};  
String s2=new String(ch);//converting char array to string  
String s3=new String("example");//creating java string by new keyword  
System.out.println(s1);  
System.out.println(s2);  
System.out.println(s3);  
}}
